            Many years ago I was introduced to Crystal and Gord. When Simplicity Catering launched, there was no doubt in my mind that they were my first call for catering services. The food is top notch but the service is out of this world. I’ve worked with many catering companies in the past but Crystal and Gord definitely far exceed  my expectations when it comes to putting the customer first. Time after time they have always been able to craft up a custom menu, provide solutions to dietary restrictions and are always willing to be challenged by different group sizes or specifications that I’ve thrown their way. We’ve had sit downs to go over menu ideas, changes in their monthly specials, etc. My favourite part is that they’ve all taken the time to understand our buildings, locations of our offices and knowing their way around the space. I am happy to say that I will always be a Simplicity Catering fan. This is a brand I can get behind.

            I’ve been using Simplicity Catering for catering at our company for several years now. I have a hungry bunch to feed for meetings from 4 – 50 people at any one time. It’s important to have lunch here on time and not once were they ever late! Crystal changes up the menu, which is great, as I don’t want to cater the same food every month to my colleagues.Gord who is one of the chefs tries new dishes and recommends them to us. We are never disappointed, whatever he makes is sooooo good! From Irish Stew to Chicken in White Wine Sauce to their Chocolate brownies...always fresh and delicious!!  I always get many thanks after catering is brought in.Everyone is super satisfied! I’ve let all of our other admins know to order from Simplicity, as they have come through with top notch catering! Call Simplicity Catering, I promise you will be NOT be disappointed!!!
